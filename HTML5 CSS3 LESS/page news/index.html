            <h1>Cowboy</h1>
            <p>Names used in the Wild West of the USA in relation to the shepherd cattle.
                The era of the cowboys started from 1865, when it was necessary to drive
                away in a giant hijacking feral herds of cattle, primarily located in Texas.

                Negroes gained their freedom after the Civil War, but had no job, no assets.
                More one-third of the cowboys were Mexicans, and a third - the descendants
                of immigrants from Europe. Cowboys worked on a ranch and cattle dealer engaged

        <h1>Mexican-Apache War</h1>
        <p>A series of conflicts between Spain
            and later Mexico and Arab tribes.
            These wars began in 1600, when the territory
            of today's New Mexico Spanish colonists arrived.
            The war between the Mexicans and Apaches was particularly
            intense in the period from 1831 to 1850. Subsequently,
            the Mexican clash with Apaches coincided with the Apache
            wars waged by the United States, such as the War of Victoria.
            Mexico continued fighting against hostile Apache bands until
            the end of 1915.The Spanish first encountered the Apache, whom
            they called Querechos, in 1541 in the Texas panhandle. At the
            time the Apache were buffalo hunting nomads who had trading
            relationships with the Pueblos of the Rio Grande valley.
            The early contacts were friendly, but in the 17th century,
            the relationship between Spaniard and Apache deteriorated
            because of slave raids by the Spaniards and Apache attacks
            on the Spanish and Pueblo settlements in New Mexico.</p>
